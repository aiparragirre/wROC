In this folder, it is avaialble all the code and results related to the simulation study. In particular:

- In the folder `Functions` all the functions needed to run the simulation study are available.
- In order to run the simulation study, run the code given in the script `exe-sim.R`.
- In order to obtain and depict the results of the simulation study, run the code in script `exe-results.R`
- In the folder `Outputs` all the results of the simulation study are available.
- In the script `application.R` we put available the code used in the application shown in the paper. Note that real data needed to run this code cannot be set publicly available due to privacy issues.
