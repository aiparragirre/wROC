# Functions

In this folder there are available all the functions needed to run the simulation study.

- `simFunction()`: is the main function.
- In the folder `Helpers` we can find three scripts containing different functions to:
  - Simulate the pseudo-population.
  - Sample the pseudo-population.
  - Different methods to estimate the AUC described in the paper: 1) unweighted method, 2) weighted AUC considering the sampling weights (proposal), and 3) weighted AUC considering pairwise sampling weights (Yao et al., 2015).
- In the folder `Results` we can find all the functions needed to obtain graphical and numerical results shown in the paper.
