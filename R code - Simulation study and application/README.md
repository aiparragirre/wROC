# Simulation study and application

In this folder, it is avaialble all the code and results related to the simulation study. In particular:

- In the folder `Functions` all the functions needed to run the simulation study are available.
- In order to run the simulation study, run the code given in the script `exe-sim.R`. Results can also be [downloaded here](http://aiparragirre006.quickconnect.to/d/s/tgfgP7Ok1PNY7DUAzIux8J3WmfJmCYyS/_ZuzJJKB0iel11EC38x5yewjBAJseQGK-q71gVYbhuQo).
- In the folder `Outputs` all the numerical results and graphics of the simulation study are available (except for the main results, which cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to space limits, and need to be downloaded from the link indicated above). All the results available in this folder have been obtained by running the code in script `exe-results.R` (please, remember to download the main results and save them in the corresponding folder before trying to run this script). 
- In the script `application.R` we put available the code used in the application shown in the paper. Note that **real data** needed to run this code **cannot be set publicly available** due to privacy issues.
